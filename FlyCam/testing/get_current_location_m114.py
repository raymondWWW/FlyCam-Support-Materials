"""
Helper Functions for the "Current Location Manager" 3D printer Gcode M114,
searches string for current location,
parses string for current location
Author: Johnny Duong
Date: 1 Apr 2021


Possible Future Updates:
-Requires separate printer serial connection module created, then this module will have manager function.


Things to think about:
-Not using the Parse library, create functions that search for the variable, gets digits afterwards until a non-digit
 or period is found
